# Notes for Chapter 10

# Note
* A security professional should be consulted for the correct way to
set up your own environment. Our commands are meant as a guide for getting
familiar and for learning, not as a production level of security. This is not
a complete guide. Use it at your own risk.
These commands are not likely to work for your setup due to the need for the domains in our example as well as tool and operating system type and versions, etc.

## Source Code/Commands for Chapter 10 location
* Check out https://github.com/Kafka-In-Action-Book/Kafka-In-Action-Source-Code/blob/master/KafkaInAction_Chapter10/Commands.md for our example commands. Commands have the strong potential to change over time and that location is able to be updated.
